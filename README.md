# Workflow Logic

The app will simulate your working style when you're away from your PC, preventing it from becoming inactive.

(I don't want to be too specific here, as it may attract unwanted attention.
If you want to know more, you can email me at **chenglong.m_at_outlook.com**.)

# Usage

Using Waker is intuitive, with its functionality directly accessible from its interface.

## Functionality

### Manual Running

Toggle the `Main Switch` in the app or the trap app menu to manually run or stop Waker.

### Set Wake-Up Interval

Define the **maximum** wake-up interval in the app to prevent certain apps from becoming inactive.

### Schedule Running Time

Set specific times for Waker to run, allowing for customized usage based on your preferences and workflow.

For example, you can set the app to run at **9:00 AM** and close at **6:00 PM** from **Monday** to **Friday**.

### Anti-Monitoring

![settings](./docs/usage/settings.png)

As shown in the `settings` menu:
1. You can customize the app's title and icons in the settings to prevent information collection by certain apps.
2. You can edit the corpus to simulate your working behavior.

This feature will be further enhanced in future versions. Welcome to contribute!

### Auto-Update

Enable automatic update checks to stay informed about the latest versions of Waker.

You can also check for updates manually in the app menu bar settings.
